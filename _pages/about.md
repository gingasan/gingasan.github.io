Hey guys, this is 伍鸿秋 (Hongqiu Wu). I am now a PhD student in Deptment of CS, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Professor Hai Zhao and Min Zhang.
My research interest includes **open virtual world**, **narrative**, and **error correction**. I achieved the best on [Adversarial GLUE](https://adversarialglue.github.io) and [HellaSWAG](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/hellaswag/submissions/public). I worked as a research intern at miHoYo. I'm serveing as reviewer for ARR, NeurIPS, ICML, etc.

# Project

### Interactive Drama

We developed LLM-based interactive drama in a script of Detective Conan, where audience can step into the play to interact with the characters. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/interactive-drama) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/698845230) Our work is accepted by ACL 2024.

### Free Pokémon

A new game genre **Open Role-Playing Game (ORPG)**. Players are allowed to craft their own pokemons by issuing natural language scripts. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/delta-engine/tree/main/delta-pokemon) [[video]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FtYkehEHF)

### Instruction-Driven Poker Engine

It allows players to craft specific games by natural language. [[demo]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1dA4m1w7xr/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=e0570b35759018455d30551c1e16a676) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/690984411) Our work is accepted by EMNLP 2024 Demonstration.

### ReLM

We released ReLM (Rephrasing Language Model), a new state-of-the-art standard for Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC). [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/lemon) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/666826419); LEMON, a novel multi-domain CSC benchmark with ByteDance. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/lemon)
