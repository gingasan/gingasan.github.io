Hey guys, this is 伍鸿秋 (Hongqiu Wu). I am now a PhD student in Deptment of CS, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Professor Hai Zhao and Min Zhang.
My research interest includes **open virtual world**, **interactive drama**, and **error correction**. I achieved the best on [AdvGLUE](https://adversarialglue.github.io) and [HellaSWAG](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/hellaswag/submissions/public). I'm serveing as reviewer/area chair for ARR, NeurIPS, etc.

I'm working as an intern at Anuttacon.

# Project

### Interactive Drama

Our second work explored the empowerment of the player that can have an impact on the characters in the drama, which is crucial for building a deep interactive experience. We call this **Agency**. [[demo]](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/67c062c50000000029029ab8?xsec_token=AB72_SeYVn1jO24ady7bgdzLsL8nX4zS4ZwQj0D0F3cQw=&xsec_source=pc_user) [[ACL 2025]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17878)



We developed LLM-based interactive drama in a script of Detective Conan, where audience can step into the play to interact with the characters. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/interactive-drama) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/698845230) [[ACL 2024]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14231)



This is our demonstration of LLM-based interactive Drama, script 《候车室的七个人》 (***Seven in the Waiting Room***).

### Free Pokémon

A new game genre **Open Role-Playing Game (ORPG)**. Players are allowed to craft their own pokemons by issuing natural language scripts. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/delta-engine/tree/main/delta-pokemon) [[video]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FtYkehEHF)

### ReLM

We released ReLM (Rephrasing Language Model), a new state-of-the-art standard for Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC). [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/lemon) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/666826419); LEMON, a novel multi-domain CSC benchmark with ByteDance. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/lemon)
