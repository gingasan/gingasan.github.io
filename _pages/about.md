Hey guys, this is 伍鸿秋 (Hongqiu Wu). I am now a PhD student in Deptment of CS, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interest is AI for games, world modeling, and error correction. I'm currently working as a research intern at miHoYo.
My favorite games include Assassin's Creed, Marvel's Spider-Man, Arknights, etc.

We developed LLM-based interactive drama in a script of Detective Conan, where audience can step into the play to interact with in-play chracters. [[demo]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sZ421x7oU/?vd_source=e0570b35759018455d30551c1e16a676) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/698845230)

We developed Instruction-Driven Poker Engine. It allows players to craft specific games by natural language. [[demo]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1dA4m1w7xr/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=e0570b35759018455d30551c1e16a676) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/690984411)

We released ReLM (Rephrasing Language Model), a new state-of-the-art standard for Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC). [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/lemon) [[zhihu]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/666826419) We released LEMON, a novel multi-domain CSC benchmark with ByteDance. [[repo]](https://github.com/gingasan/lemon)

I achieved the best on [Adversarial GLUE](https://adversarialglue.github.io) and [HellaSWAG](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/hellaswag/submissions/public) (05/03/2022).
